# Cevap

Not only delicious food, this is also a simple example on how to use/deploy/dockerize  [neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org) based applications, using installation instructions as seen on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/pachamaltese/afc4faef2f191b533556f261a46b3aa8).

I could not find any example on how to do it, so here it is!

## Do try this at home!

- `docker build -t cevap .` beware: this may take a long time, as mkl installs a lot of libs, go grap a coffee
- `docker run --name cevap --rm -d -p 3000:3000 cevap`
- `curl localhost:3000/rec?max=100`
- `docker kill cevap`
